# Explainable AI

## Introduction
Machine learning algorithms' output and outcomes may now be understood and trusted by human users thanks to a collection of procedures and techniques known as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). An AI model, its anticipated effects, and potential biases are all described in terms of explainable AI. It contributes to defining model correctness, fairness, transparency, and results in decision-making supported by AI. When bringing AI models into production, a business must first establish trust and confidence. A company may adopt a responsible approach to AI development with the aid of AI explainability.

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a set of processes and methods that allows human users to comprehend and trust the results and output created by machine learning algorithms. Explainable AI is used to describe an AI model, its expected impact and potential biases. It helps characterize model accuracy, fairness, transparency and outcomes in AI-powered decision making. Explainable AI is crucial for an organization in building trust and confidence when putting AI models into production. AI explainability also helps an organization adopt a responsible approach to AI development.

## Pretrained models which used by XAI algorithms

### VGG variations

A convolutional neural network with n layers (we used 16 or 19) is called VGG-nn. The ImageNet database contains a pretrained version of the network that has been trained on more than a million pictures (check [ImageNet]("https://image-net.org/")). The pretrained network can categorize photos into 1000 different item categories, including several animals, a keyboard, a mouse, and a pencil. The network has therefore acquired rich feature representations for a variety of pictures. The network usually accepts images with a resolution of 224 by 224.
### DecisionTree
A decision tree uses a tree structure to develop classification or regression models. It progressively develops an associated decision tree while segmenting a dataset into smaller and smaller sections. The outcome is a tree containing leaf nodes and decision nodes. There are two or more branches on a decision node. A judgment or categorization is represented by a leaf node. A decision tree's root node is the highest decision node and the greatest predictor. Both category and numerical data may be processed using decision trees.
### RandomForest
Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Could work for both classification and regression problems. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out either a continues value or a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction.

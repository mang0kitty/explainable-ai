# Explainable AI

## Introduction
Machine learning algorithms' output and outcomes may now be understood and trusted by human users thanks to a collection of procedures and techniques known as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). An AI model, its anticipated effects, and potential biases are all described in terms of explainable AI. It contributes to defining model correctness, fairness, transparency, and results in decision-making supported by AI. When bringing AI models into production, a business must first establish trust and confidence. A company may adopt a responsible approach to AI development with the aid of AI explainability.

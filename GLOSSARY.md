* **AI**: Artificial Intelligence
* **Black box**: Researchers and users often know the inputs and outputs of a machine-learning model, but it is difficult to observe what is going on inside the "black box" that represents the decision-making process of a machine-learning model. This is why the process is sometimes referred to as a "black box."
* **Grad-Cam**: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
* **LIME**: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
* **LRP**: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation

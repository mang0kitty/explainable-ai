    "\n",
    "Grad-Cam (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) coming from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391.pdf) and provided by this [repository](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam) is a well known XAI algorithm and was created for the VGG16 network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives us a tool to examine which specific aspects of the image had an impact on the overall model's choice of a given label. It is very helpful when examining samples that were incorrectly categorised. The Grad-CAM method is fairly understandable and quite easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm's intuition is based on the assumption that the model must have examined a few pixels (or portions of the image) and determined what item was present there. A gradient can be used to represent influence mathematically. That is what the algorithm accomplishes in a broad sense. Finding the gradient of the most dominating logit with regard to the most recent activation map in the model is the first step."
